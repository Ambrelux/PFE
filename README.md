# End of studies project : Sound waves' modelisation in a virtual environment

## Introduction :

The aim of the project is to create a simulator which allows users to visualize sound wavesâ€™ trajectories and energy loss. Users will be able to create new sounds and replay old ones in a chosen space.
Users will be able to set up the simulation :
	-by changing materials parameters
	-and also adding new elements to the chosen scene

## How to use the simulation :

This simulation uses Unity 2020.1.13f.

To save sounds' data and replay previous sounds you must install Docker in order to launch the API: https://www.docker.com/

To start the API use the following command : ```docker-compose up```
To stop the API use the following command : ```docker-compose down```
